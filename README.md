> [!CAUTION]
> This plug-in will likely break with every CS2 update. You'll need to update the signature for either Windows or Linux on your own. If you happy to share the current signatures I will update this plug-in accordingly.

This is a simple Infinite Weapon plug-in which allows a player to carry more then one primary or secondary weapon. Hint: this plug-in will likely break with any CS2 update because it uses modified gamedata. If the plug-in is not working anymore please check this repository first and open a Github Issue if a newer version does not solve your issue.

This plug-in automatically updates the gamedata.json of your CounterstrikeSharp installation for you! Therefore please restart the game server after installing/updating the plug-in and starting the game server.

## Installation

1. Download and extract the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Kandru/cs2-infinite-weapons/releases/).
2. Move the "InfiniteWeapons" folder to the `/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/` directory.
3. (Re)start the server and wait for it to be completely loaded.
4. Restart the server again because it maybe applied some Gamedata entries for the plug-in to work correctly.

Updating is even easier: simply overwrite all plugin files and they will be reloaded automatically. To automate updates please use our [CS2 Update Manager](https://github.com/Kandru/cs2-update-manager/).


## Configuration

This plugin automatically creates a readable JSON configuration file. This configuration file can be found in `/addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/InfiniteWeapons/InfiniteWeapons.json`.

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "debug": true,
  "signature_file": "InfiniteWeapons.json",
  "permissions": {
    "@css/root": {
      "max_primary_weapons": 5,
      "max_secondary_weapons": 5
    }
  },
  "permissions_is_whitelist": false,
  "max_primary_weapons": 2,
  "max_secondary_weapons": 2,
  "override_signature_windows": "",
  "override_signature_linux": "",
  "ConfigVersion": 1
}
```

### enabled

Whether this plug-in is enabled or not.

### debug

Debug mode. Only necessary during development or testing.

### signature_file

File to write the signature too. Defaults to *InfiniteWeapons.json* to avoid conflicts when CounterstrikeSharp gets updated. Can be changed to whatever you like.

### permissions

Allows to add different permissions with different amount of weapons for players in this group. Only checks until first occurence for a player is found.

### permissions_is_whitelist

Whether or not a player must have the correct permission to use infinite weapons.

### max_primary_weapons

Maximum number of primary weapons. More then 2 are possible but you cannot easily switch between them.

### max_secondary_weapons

Maximum number of secondary weapons. More then 2 are possible but you cannot easily switch between them.

### override_signature_windows

When the signature changes and no new release is available you can override the signature yourself. Make sure to remove the signature when updating this plug-in because this settings overrides the signatures that come with the plug-in.

### override_signature_linux

When the signature changes and no new release is available you can override the signature yourself. Make sure to remove the signature when updating this plug-in because this settings overrides the signatures that come with the plug-in.

## Commands
